A Hugo theme ported from [Webjeda cards](https://webjeda.com/cards/).
<!--more-->

I was looking for a theme to use as base of the [VGCStats articles section](/portfolio/articles). I could not find a theme I liked in the Official Hugo theme list, but I find one in the Jekyll Themes page. 

For a second I thought making the articles section using Jekyll, but I am really fond of Hugo (not just because of the namesake, lol), so I decided to give a shot into porting the theme.

The porting was a very straightforward process. All functionaly found in the original theme was successfully ported.

I submitted the theme to the official Hugo theme list and it was accepted, so you can find it [there](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-cards/).

I also made a [demo site](https://hugo-cards-site.netlify.com/), where you can se how the theme looks.
